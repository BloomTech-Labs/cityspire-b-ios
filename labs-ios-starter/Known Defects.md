#  CitySpire's Known bugs, incomplete features, and issues on Github
 
1. Was not able to connect to Data Science's Back-end due to time constraints. 
2. Toggling favorite's button in detail view always removes that favorite city.
3. Was not able to implement the feature where the user could save favorite cities to the authenticated profile.
